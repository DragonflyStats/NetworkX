Assumption of Normality 
===============================
 
One of the assumptions of many statistical procedures (including the t-test) is that the population from which you are sampling is normally distributed. The t-test is said to be rather ‘robust’ in terms of this 
assumption, which means that reality can deviate from this assumption a fair amount without seriously affecting the validity of the analysis. 
 
This is particularly true when the size of the samples is large (thanks to the Central Limit Theorem). Some deviations from normality can pose a problem for the t-test, specifically those that involve getting extreme 
scores more frequently than you would if the distribution were normal. Statistical Software Packages provides two statistical tests for deviation 
from normality, the 'Kolomogorov-Smirnov' family of tests and the 'Shapiro-Wilk' test. The 'Kolomogorov-Smirnov' test can be used to test if two data sets are distributed according to the same distribution. It can also be used to test if one data set comes from a specified distribution, such as the normal distribution. ( As such, the normal distribution must be specified as an  argument to the function.) 

For the purposes of this module, we will only use a special case of the 'Kolomogorov-Smirnov' test, known as the ‘ Anderson-Darling' test of 
normality. 

The ‘Anderson-Darling’ test can not be implemented directly in R. Using the test requires the installation of the nortest package. We will look at 
packages in greater detail later in the semester. 
 
The null hypothesis of both the `Anderson-Darling’ and `Shapiro-Wilk’ tests is that the population is normally distributed, and the alternative 
hypothesis is that the data is not normally distributed.
