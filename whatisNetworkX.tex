Features[edit]

A graph created with NetworkX
Classes for graphs and digraphs.
Conversion of graphs to and from several formats.
Ability to construct random graphs or construct them incrementally.
Ability to find subgraphs, cliques, k-cores.
Explore adjacency, degree, diameter, radius, center, betweenness, etc.
Draw networks in 2D and 3D.
Suitability[edit]
NetworkX is suitable for operation on large real-world graphs: e.g., graphs in excess of 10 million nodes and 100 million edges.[1] Due to its dependence on a pure-Python "dictionary of dictionary" data structure, NetworkX is a reasonably efficient, very scalable, highly portable framework for network and social network analysis.[2]
